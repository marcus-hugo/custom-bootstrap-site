# Custom Bootstrap Website for a Fictional Cleaning Service

## My Goals

I wanted to piece together a proffesionaly built website with Bootstrap 5. It had to be customizable for theme and color for what ever business. It had to include some basic marketing patterns, including, a discount banner, a CTA, features, testimonials, and a contact form. It had to include some designer assets, which I found with hero patterns. The images are from Unsplash.

Bootstrap solves so many development patterns "out of the box", with responsivenss, functionality, and accessibility in mind without having to be a specialist in those areas. I took it a step up and made some customizations to colors.

With feedback from Google Lighthouse, for performance the images are in the latest webp format and the CSS is minified and purged.
